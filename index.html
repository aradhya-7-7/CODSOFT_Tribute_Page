            <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b>, also known as <b>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</b>, was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He was known as the "Missile Man of India" for his role in developing ballistic missiles and launch vehicles. He was elected as the eleventh president of India in 2002 with the support of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. He is widely referred to as the "People's President". He served a single term as president and returned to his civilian life of education, writing, and public service.
